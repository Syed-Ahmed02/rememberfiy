## 🛠️ Technical Updates

### Backend Dependencies
```python
# New/Updated dependencies:
replicate       # AI model integration
convex          # Database client
pillow          # Image processing
python-dotenv   # Environment variables
```

### Frontend Dependencies
```typescript
// New dependencies needed:
@clerk/nextjs   # Authentication
convex          # Database client
convex/react    # React hooks for Convex
```

### Database Schema (Convex)
```javascript
// Key tables:
- users (with Clerk integration)
- quizzes (with file type tracking)
- questions (quiz questions)
- quiz_attempts (user progress)
```

### AI Models (Replicate)
```python
# Recommended models:
- "meta/llama-2-70b-chat" for quiz generation
- "meta/llama-2-70b-chat" for summarization  
- "meta/llama-2-70b-chat" for Socratic tutoring
- "salesforce/blip" for image captioning
- OCR models for image text extraction
```

## 🎯 Updated Demo Scenarios

### Primary Demo (5 minutes)
1. **User Registration** (30 seconds)
   - Sign up with Clerk
   - Verify email

2. **Content Upload** (1.5 minutes)
   - **NEW**: Upload sample PDF, image, or paste text
   - View AI-generated summary
   - **NEW**: Show different file type handling
   - **NEW**: Demonstrate image OCR capabilities

3. **Quiz Generation** (2 minutes)
   - Generate quiz from content using Replicate
   - Answer 3-4 questions
   - Get wrong answer, use tutor

4. **Tutor Interaction** (1 minute)
   - Ask tutor for help
   - Receive Socratic guidance via Replicate

5. **Dashboard Review** (30 seconds)
